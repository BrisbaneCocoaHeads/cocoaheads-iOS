Contributing
============

Development happens in github. Please fork this repository:

`git://github.com/BrisbaneCocoaHeads/cocoaheads-iOS.git`

After cloning your fork, add the parent as an additional remote:

`$ git remote add parent git://github.com/BrisbaneCocoaHeads/cocoaheads-iOS.git`

So that when you need update your branch (eg 'master'), you can do so locally with:

`$ git pull parent master`
